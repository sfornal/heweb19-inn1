### Resources

The book _[Going Offline](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline)_ by Jeremy Keith was my starting point with building our service worker.

The Mozilla Developers Network documentation of the ServiceWorker, Fetch, and Cache APIs are invaluable.

Google's Chrome browser has the best Dev tools for debugging service workers right now (unfortunately, haha)
